# Experiment "exp1"

## Introduction

CA rules are limited to:

* Max life of 1,000T
* Can reproduce at 160T (if survives)
* 

The universe keeps a log of all activity of all entities. Here is an example readout:
```
1. CA44 moved from X24Y08 to X25Y08. (-1 energy).
2. CA45 predicts that the plant at X44Y44 is edible and eats it. Oops! It's poison. CA45 dies.
3. CA46 predicts that the plant at X03Y90 is edible and eats it. Yum! +10 energy.
4. CA47 tries to share knowledge with CA10 but she doesn't know anything about the plants yet :<
5. CA48 shares knowledge about edible plants with CA31. (-1 energy).
6. 
```

CA Rules:
* Energy starts at 100
* Every action takes 1 energy.
* Every turn, take an action:

CA Actions:
