# Cellular Agent Research Experiment System (CARES)

The Cellular Agent Research Experiment System (CARES) is a modular, programmable
toolset designed to study autonomous agents in a discrete, cellular environment. 

# Quickstart

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jesselawson/cares.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd cares && pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the example experiment: `python experiments/example1.py`
4. Study the output in the `experiments/example1` folder. You'll have a compiled gif of
all state configurations at each time step, and *.jpg copies of the state configuration 
at each time step.
